# OpenDevin: Code Less, Make More

[demo-video.webm]()

## Mission üéØ

Welcome to OpenDevin, an open-source project aiming to replicate [Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin), an autonomous AI software engineer who is capable of executing complex engineering tasks and collaborating actively with users on software development projects. This project aspires to replicate, enhance, and innovate upon Devin through the power of the open-source community.

## Work in Progress

OpenDevin is still a work in progress. But you can run the alpha version to see things working end-to-end.

### Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) >= 14.8

### Installation

First, make sure Nodejs is running:

```bash
node -v # this should show the version of node
```

Running on the command line

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
npm start
```

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Research Strategy

Achieving full replication of production-grade applications with LLMs is a complex endeavor. Our strategy involves:

1. **Core Technical Research:** Focusing on foundational research to understand and improve the technical aspects of code generation and handling.
2. **Specialist Abilities:** Enhancing the effectiveness of core components through data curation, training methods, and more.
3. **Task Planning:** Developing capabilities for bug detection, codebase management, and optimization.
4. **Evaluation:** Establishing comprehensive evaluation metrics to better understand and improve our models.

## üõ† Technology Stack

- **Frontend Interface:** Developing user-friendly interfaces for monitoring, potentially leveraging frameworks/libs like React or creating a VSCode plugin for a more integrated experience,etc....
